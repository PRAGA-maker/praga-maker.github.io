tracking progress on one of my research projects

keep the UI calm, clean, with care full of little interactibles + cool things if you can find em like search online for cool lil pixel art interactibles, cool ideas dedicate substantial study + implementation time for this

extremely unindustrial, don't worry about it being nice for everyone just make it kinda bubbly

going to be hosted on Github Pages, so self-sustaining ie. hardcode a DB, and i'll just manually push new datapoints 

also this is one prompt im just having fun with this so try to capture everything needed to execute my vision -- you can resolve ambiguity using my philsophy insofar i've already described 

anyway in this the goal is just two big sidebyside XY graphs: one being:

date vs. Brier score (y-scale log)

current data:
0.6, 2 weeks ago, random baseline
0.2, 1 week ago,  barely working implementation
0.1, 5 days ago, RLM
0.06, today , Agentic Ensemble

today is 1/26/2026 btw, u should prolly store as a date haha

and the other being

date vs. PnL

*no current data*


and then at the bottom a scrollable table with Date | Brier | PnL | What We Did
